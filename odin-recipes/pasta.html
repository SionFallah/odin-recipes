    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>1 Garlic Clove</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling,
            add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 
            minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the
            mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is 
            full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. 
            Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water
            if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        </ol>
