    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>Fresh Chopped Herbs</li>
            <li>¼ Cup Half and Half</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ Teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, aggressively whisk together the eggs, half-n-half, and salt until the mixture is uniform in color and texture,
            and is light and foamy, without any separate streaks of yolk or whites.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small nonstick pan over medium heat,
            until the butter coats the whole pan and just starts to foam.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs to the center of the pan and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are mostly cooked, with big pillow-y folds, but still look pretty wet, 
            slowly fold the eggs into itself just a couple times, bringing them together.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat when the eggs still shimmer with some moisture.</li>
        </ol>
